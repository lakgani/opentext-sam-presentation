# Why Serverless

<v-click>

## Advantages

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

* No need to pay for any resources if its not being used.
* No need to handle server provisioning and maintainance
* No need to handle the scaling.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## Disadvantages

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

* Cold boot
* Increased development complexity

</v-clicks>

# Types of serverless applications
* API
* Event driven applications
* scheduled applications


---

# Traditional development pattern and its issues
* Manually creating infra using AWS UI is not scalable.
* Changing file locally and uploading everytime a change is done / Using Cloud9 tool to write the lambda functions has its fair share of issues
* Need to write a lot of custom code to zip and deploy for CICD.


---

# AWS SAM to rescue
* Its a combination of 
  * Template file
  * cli


---

# SAM Key features
* Infrastructure as code.
* Local debugging and testing support
* Stream logs of Lambdas running on AWS
* real-time development in AWS
* Generate sample event payloads


---

# Prerequisites
* AWS account with necessary priviliges 
* AWS credentials configured for cli usage
* AWS SAM installed
* Docker (only for local dev setup)


---

# Infrastructure as code
* Time saving
* Repeatable
* Consistent


---

# Supported resources 

* Lambda
* API Gateway 
* DynamoDB


---

# Example: Simple lambda

```yaml{0|1,2|3|4|5|6-11|12-20|all}
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
  HelloWorldFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: hello_world/
      Handler: app.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.9
      Architectures:
        - x86_64
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```


---

# Simplified deployment

`sam deploy`


---

# Local debugging and testing support

## Invoke lambdas with predefined events
`sam local invoke "HelloWorldFunction" -e event.json`

## Emulate API Gateway HTTP server locally
`sam local start-api`


---

# Generate sample event payloads

`sam local generate-event s3 [put/delete] --bucket <bucket> --key <key>`

# Stream logs of Lambdas running on AWS

```shell
$ sam logs -n mystack-HelloWorldFunction-1FJ8PD36GML2Q
```

```shell
$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --tail
```

```shell
$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --filter 'error'
```


---

# real-time deployment to AWS
`sam sync`


---

# 

# Other notable features
* Lambda layers
* tracing


---

# Few issues
* Not all features are supported locally
* Real-time development in AWS is still slow for regular development tasks(Serverless Stack seems to be good alternative here)
